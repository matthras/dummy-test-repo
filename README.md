# dummy-test-repo
Literally a repo for me to test random stuff with.

## Want to contribute?
Egads I wouldn't know why but sure, submit a pull request!

### It's actually really easy to edit stuff in the browser, wow.

I'm now writing more nonsensical stuff to track changes between commits/pull requests. Wheeeeee!
