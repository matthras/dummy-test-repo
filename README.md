# dummy-test-repo
Literally a repo for me to test random stuff with.

## Want to contribute?
Egads I wouldn't know why but sure, submit a pull request!

### It's actually really easy to edit stuff in the browser, wow.

Github User NeoPsychic wants to add more writing to this! Weee!

I'm now writing more nonsensical stuff to track changes between commits/pull requests. Wheeeeee!
